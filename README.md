# thesis

My bachelor thesis in statistics. I have completed two more theses as well, but I consider this one to be cleaner.

## Abstract 

_We compare two time series models: an ARMA(1,1)-ACD(1,1)-NIG model against an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1)-NIG model. Their out-of-sample performance is of interest rather than their in-sample properties. The models produce one-day ahead forecasts which are evaluated using three statistical tests: VaR-test, VaRdur-test and Berkowitz-test. All three tests are concerned with the the tail events, since our time series models are often used to estimate downside risk._

_When the two models are applied to data on Canadian stock market returns, our three statistical tests point in the direction that the ACD model and the GARCH model perform similarly. The difference between the models is small._

_We finish with comments on the model uncertainty inherit in the comparison._

## Report 

`Thesis-report.pdf` contains the actual thesis. 

## Slides 

`Thesis-slides.pdf` is a summary of my thesis in the form av a presentation. 

## Report vs Slides

If you are short on time or experienced with time series analysis (especially ARMA and GARCH) then reading the slides will suffice. 

If you are not experienced or want to understand the details, read the report.

## Code 

In the appendix I have included some output. The actual code used for modelling might be uploaded later on.
